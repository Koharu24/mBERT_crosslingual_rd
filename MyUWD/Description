# MyUWD
The following folder contains three Excel files offering a dictionary modelling dataset listing untranslatable German, Italian and Japanese words.

It is a purposefully self-created small multilingual lexical database containing a bilingual list of word-definition pairs: each  term in German, Italian or Japanese (Lg1) is paired with all its possible definitions in English (Lg2) retrieved from various online lexical resources, both English (Wiktionary, WordSense, Eunoia) and language-specific monolingual online dictionaries (Duden, DWDS (Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache), and Pons for German; MultiWordNet, Treccani, Sabatini-Coletti, Hoepli, De Agostini, il nuovo De Mauro for Italian; Jisho, TanoshiiJapaneseDictionary, Nihongomaster, JapanDict, Weblio for Japanese). 

For each lexical entry, a series of linguistic information are additionally given: Transcription into ideograms and/or non-Latin characters (for JPN only), ISO language code, POS, ambiguity, usage and meaning (for disambiguation and other info about context and frequency of usage), polysemy, frequency (for DE and JPN only), semantic field, synonyms (in English), tags, sentence examples, possible English translation of the sentence example, etymology.

### Definitions 
Thanks to manual compilation, it was possible to control for the length of the definitions, avoiding extremely long definitions with useless or secondary information, the latter being however inserted as additional features in the other fields of the database.  
It should be specified that “definitions” here would be better referred to as “senses” because each row of the csv files matches a term with a description expressing one and one only possible usage of that word. Accordingly, a polysemous lexical entry is repeated multiple times throughout the database, as its multiple instances are each associated with a sentence indicating one precise sense of that word. This enables the differential contexts of usage of a specific term along with a practical sentence example to be all plainly and orderly reported in the dictionary dataset. 

### Semantic Field

A list of 24 categories has been here selected and systematically used to assign each word a semantic field. Inspired by Magnini et al.’s work on the role of domain information in word sense disambiguation (see https://wndomains.fbk.eu/hierarchy.html), it is firmly believed that domain information plays a big/significant part in case of ambiguity and polysemy.

23.	Emotion = only mental: state-of-mind, psychological feature
24.	Feeling = (both mental and physical-sensorial)

### Tags

Keywords of terms and concepts related to the target-word which provides semantic details to narrow their domain information down to more specific content (ex. “free time” tag for “sport” domain label; “death” for “action”; “grammatical value” for “language”; “art” or “hobby” for “activity”)

### Frequency (DE and JPN only)
https://www.duden.de/hilfe/haeufigkeit from Duden’s Corpus

Levels of Frequency -> 1 to 5    -    % occurrences

0-> obsolete        - (not included or irrelevant)


### Example sentences in Lg1
Just like domain information, sentences showing practical examples on the context of usage of a term wield a strong disambiguating power. On this account, the inclusion of sentence examples, here expressed both in English and in the target languages (German, Italian or Japanese), represents a valuable and essential resource in a dictionary database.

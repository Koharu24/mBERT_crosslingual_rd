# MyUWD
The following folder contains three Excel files offering a dictionary modelling dataset listing untranslatable German, Italian and Japanese words.

It is a purposefully self-created small multilingual lexical database containing a bilingual list of word-definition pairs: each  term in German, Italian or Japanese (Lg1) is paired with all its possible definitions in English (Lg2) retrieved from various online lexical resources, both English (Wiktionary, WordSense, Eunoia) and language-specific monolingual online dictionaries (Duden, DWDS (Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache), and Pons for German; MultiWordNet, Treccani, Sabatini-Coletti, Hoepli, De Agostini, il nuovo De Mauro for Italian; Jisho, TanoshiiJapaneseDictionary, Nihongomaster, JapanDict, Weblio for Japanese). 

For each lexical entry, a series of linguistic information are additionally given: Transcription into ideograms and/or non-Latin characters (for JPN only), ISO language code, POS, ambiguity, usage and meaning (for disambiguation and other info about context and frequency of usage), polysemy, frequency (for DE and JPN only), semantic field, synonyms (in English), tags, sentence examples, possible English translation of the sentence example, etymology.

### Semantic Field

A list of 24 categories has been here selected and systematically used to assign each word a semantic field. Inspired by Magnini et al.’s work on the role of domain information in word sense disambiguation (see https://wndomains.fbk.eu/hierarchy.html), it is firmly believed that domain information plays a big/significant part in case of ambiguity and polysemy.

### Tags

Keywords of terms and concepts related to the target-word which provides semantic details to narrow their domain information down to more specific content (ex. “free time” tag for “sport” domain label; “death” for “action”; “grammatical value” for “language”; “art” or “hobby” for “activity”)

### Frequency (DE and JPN only)
https://www.duden.de/hilfe/haeufigkeit from Duden’s Corpus

Levels of Frequency -> 1 to 5    -    % occurrences

0-> obsolete        - (not included or irrelevant)

1-> extremely rare     <1 (0.0099 – 0.99)

2-> rare/obsolete    >1 (1 – 9.9)

3-> neither obscure/opaque nor common    > 10 (10 – 99)

4-> common   > 100 (100 – 999)

5-> extremely common; everyday usage     >1 000 times (1000)
